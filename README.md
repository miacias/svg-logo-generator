## Description

Every business or social endeavor does better when it can reach out via multimedia. Great metrics start with visibility, and this app can be the very first step in building a simple, preliminary logo for free when first getting started. Of course, please consider researching and commissioning a human artist to design a more intricate and professional-quality logo, but for beginners, this is the place to start.
